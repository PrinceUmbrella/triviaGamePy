# Trivia Game in Python

After downloading the code run these two commands in the terminal

```
pip install prettytable
pip install jsonschema
```

then go to the `gamePlay.py` and start the game

1. If you want to add your own questions replace the `questionsInput.json` file with the same formatting. To check there is any errors in the input formatting of the question file use the `validateQuestion.py` and run it.
2. To increase the number of players replace the `NUMBER_OF_PLAYERS` inside `gamePlay.py` with the number you want or uncomment the number of players line.

```
NUMBER_OF_QUESTION_PER_PLAYER = 5
NUMBER_OF_PLAYERS = 2
```
